# Hey, Coworker!

This is a small collection of idiosynchracies, philosophies, and principles I hold to when working as a software engineer.

What this is _**not**_:

* A line in the sand. The vagaries of projects demands, people, and team cultures may require me to operate in a different way. I get that.

## Communication

### Chat

Please don't say hello.

More specifically, don't _just_ say hello, then make me watch your typing indicator while you gather your thoughts. It's such a time suck. [nohello.net](https://www.nohello.net) does a good job of explaining it.

### Checking e-mail, IMs, and other manner of notifications

A series of analyses and surveys reported out in a [study by Ninlabs research](https://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/) had the following findings:

> * A programmer takes between 10-15 minutes to start editing code after resuming work from an interruption.
> * When interrupted during an edit of a method, only 10% of times did a programmer resume work in less than a minute.
> * A programmer is likely to get just one uninterrupted 2-hour session in a day

I agree with these findings. Getting pulled out of flow is sometimes necessary, but I work hard to make it an exception, not a rule. I throttle my notifications and check in 2-3 times a day. If it's urgent, call me.

### Updates

Given the choice, I would rather set my own timetable and write out my updates thoughtfully and comprehensively.

## Meetings

### Agendaless meetings

### Candy striping meetings
