# Hey, Coworker!

This is a small collection of idiosynchracies, philosophies, and principles I hold to when working as a software engineer.

What this is _**not**_:

* A concert rider for a diva. If anything I hope these thoughts are logical and reasonable. If I come across differently, I hope you tell me so.
* A line in the sand. The vagaries of projects demands, people, and team cultures may require me to operate in a different way. I get that.

## Why did I do this?

I don't always communicate my needs clearly or kindly, especially in the throes of project deliveryâ€”I am only human, after all. This is my attempt at expressing my thinking on productivity collegially.

I hope that, in scanning this document, you think through your own ways of working and, if we don't see eye to eye, we negotiate an agreement that allows us to focus on our goal: delivering the best software/project/outcome.

## Communication

### Checking e-mail, IMs, and other manner of notifications

A series of analyses and surveys reported out in a [study by Ninlabs research](https://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/) had the following findings:

> * A programmer takes between 10-15 minutes to start editing code after resuming work from an interruption.
> * When interrupted during an edit of a method, only 10% of times did a programmer resume work in less than a minute.
> * A programmer is likely to get just one uninterrupted 2-hour session in a day

I agree with these findings. Getting pulled out of flow is sometimes necessary, but I work hard to make it an exception, not a rule. I throttle my notifications and check in 2-3 times a day. If it's urgent, call me.

### Chat

Please don't say hello.

More specifically, don't _just_ say hello, then make me watch your typing indicator while you gather your thoughts. It's such a time suck. [nohello.net](https://www.nohello.net) does a good job of explaining it.

### Project Updates

Given the choice, I would rather write out my updates in some shared place. They will be thoughtful, comprehensive, and we will have a record of them. This doesn't mean I dislike standups, only that I prefer to read my standup from a script.

## Guarding my time

Most of my effort around meetings is defensive. Wherever possible I work to protect those elusive, uninterrupted, 2-hour blocks of time in my day where I can be the most effective engineer. These are the things that get in the way of doing my job:

### Agendaless meetings

If I ever have to meet with you, out of respect for your time and a desire to get what I need in the shortest timeframe possible, I'll make an agenda. It will have an introduction and a series of questions I need answered. If you did the same I think you'd find our time together to be more productive.

What I'm looking to avoid is wasting time helping you organize your own thoughts when they should be in your agenda.

Here's some common things I hear when I bring this up:

> "I don't know what I don't know!"

Are we talking about backend? frontend? cupcakes? You know something that constrains your inquiry. Put it in words.

> "This is a brainstorming session"

I can't wait to participate! But what are we brainstorming and what kind of brainstorming will make this useful to you? What do you hope to walk away with?

> "I'm just looking for guidance"

I'd love to help you get what you need. But help me to do that:

* I might be in a good brainspace to ask some followup questions of my own and add them to our shared agenda.
* I might have a heap of resources to drop on you with direction as to where to look.
* Someone else may have already answered your question better than I can.
* I might not be the right person to help you, but I might be able to get you the right contact.

### Candy striping meetings

TBD

### My preference: bookended meetings

TBD

### I am not your emotional support technologist

Please don't pull me into meetings because you _think_ you _might_ need me. Rather, consider letting me know you might pull me into a meeting and add me as optional. If I'm available, I'll accept and monitor my chats.
